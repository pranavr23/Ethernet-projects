This project sets up a TCP echo server. It listens for incoming connections, receives data size requests from clients, fills a buffer with test data accordingly, and sends it back. It handles data transfer and connection management callbacks for the server operation.

The Python script connects to the TCP echo server, requests a specific number of bytes, receives data in packets, verifies received data against expected values, and prints any errors. It ensures data integrity during transmission from the server.
