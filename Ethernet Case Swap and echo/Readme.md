Ethernet server application that runs on a Zynq 7000-based FPGA board (Zybo Z7). Vivado/Vitis 2023.1 creates the Zynq processor and the server application. The application is called an echo server, and as the name implies, any character sent to it through an Ethernet connection is repeated back to the host with its case swapped.
