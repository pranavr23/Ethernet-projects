This project sets up a TCP server. Upon connection, it sends the string "80085" to the client. Callbacks manage data transmission and reception, handling client requests and server responses efficiently.

The Python script connects to a TCP server, requests 5 bytes, receives data in segments, and validates if the received data matches the expected value "80085".
